# Demonstrate how to:
# -------------------
# 1) Convert an int to a float
a = 1
a = float(a)
print(a)
# 2) Convert a float to an int
b = 3.14
b = int(b)
print(b)
# 3) Perform division using a float and an int.
c = 17.3
d = 3
print(c/d)
# 4) Use two variables to perform a multiplication.
e = 146
f = 3.77
print (e*f)
# What information is lost during which conversions?
